<p>1. Have students watch and discuss the video “Census Ocean Observing.”

Tell students that they will be using a series of videos and online resources to explore human impacts on specific marine species. Distribute the Marine Migration Video Notetaking worksheet and have students read the directions and questions for the video “Census Ocean Observing.” Show students the Census of Marine Life video (4 minutes). Allow students time to answer the questions on the worksheet. Then check students’ answers.

    According to the video, what are three threats that affect all nations? (overfishing, pollution, and the destruction of coastal habitats)

    What effects can changing ocean temperatures have on marine organisms? (changes in where species live and travel, distribution of essential nutrients, shifts in food webs)

    What is the Census of Marine Life? (a 10-year, 80-nation collaboration of marine scientists working on new technologies that monitor and measure life within an emerging global ocean observing system.)

    What types of technologies are the scientists developing and using in their research? (acoustic sensing to track marine animals at large scales; cataloguing of short DNA sequences for rapid and accurate species identification and biodiversity assessment; satellite tagging devices that can study animal life histories, collect physical and chemical data in previously inaccessible areas of the ocean, and track migratory routes to identify feeding and mating hotspots)

    What are some of the outcomes scientists hope to achieve with this research? (to measure the impact of climate change on marine life; to manage fisheries, coastal ecosystems, and water pollution; to detect harmful bacteria in seas; and discover new pharmaceuticals to help save lives)
